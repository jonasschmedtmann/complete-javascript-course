We will createmanipulate the modal window using js 
so we are moving this class " hidden"

1. what we want to do is to take the modal 

duvida1: onde est√° a classe .modal? 
onde esta a classe .hidden? no html 

IN PRATIICE WE USE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ADDING AND REMOVING CLASSES ALL THE TIME 
IN ORDER TO CHANGE APPERENCE OF ELEMENTS ON OUR PAGE 

IT HAPPENS BECAUSE CLASSSES ALLOW US TO BASICALLY AGGREGATE MULTIPLE CSS PROPERTIES IN JUST ONE LIKE A CONTAINER
SO EACH CLASS FUNTIONS A BIT LIKE A CONTAINER WITH A LOT OF PROPERTIES IN IT.

AND BY ADDING AND REMOVING THEM WE CAN BASICALLY ACTIVATE AND DEACTIVATE CERTAIN STYLES ALL AT THE SAME TIME 

const OpenModal = function () {
  console.log('Button clicked');
  modal.classList.remove('hidden');
  overlay.classList.remove('hidden');
};
const closeModal = function () {
  modal.classList.add('hidden');
  overlay.classList.add('hidden');
};

for (let i = 0; i < btnOpenModal.length; i++)
  btnOpenModal[i].addEventListener('click', OpenModal);
// THE DOT IS ONLY FOR THE SELECTOR, HERE WE JUST PASS THE NAME OF THE CLASS

btnCloseModal.addEventListener('click', closeModal);

overlay.addEventListener('click', closeModal);

// WE ARE NOT CALLING THE FUNCTION () !! IF WE DID THAT IT WOULD EXECUTE IMEDIATELLY BUT WE JUST
// WANT IT TO HAPPEN THE CLICK EVENT HAPPENS
// 'click' is the name of the event and after we write the function
// just like and if-else statement, when there's only one line of code that I want to execute, I actually don't have to use curly braces (a block)
// now we need to add a modal

//for (let i = 0); i < btnOpenModal.length; i++){
//consobtnOpenModal[i].addEventListener(click, function () {});
//}

THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO WITH CLASSES IS TO CHECK IF A CLASS IS ACTUALLY PRESENT ON A CERTAIN ELEMENT
