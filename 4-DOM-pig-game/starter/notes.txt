DOM manipulation and and the DOM

* DOM: document object model;
* Structured representation of an htm document;
* The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript;
* For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with
* JavaScript and the DOM are two different things

THE OBJECT THAT GIVES US ACCESS TO THE DOM IS THE DOCUMENT OBJECT

**** EVENT HANDLING ****
Events: Notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage;

Examples: clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down or pressing a key;

Event Listeners: a function that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific event to happen.

* Events are processed only after the execution stack is empty meaning all functions have completed (returened).
* The message queue is something else that lives in the javascript engine
* When an event happens and the message is recieved it gets it's own execution context becuase it is a function and this execution context then gets placed on the execution stack
